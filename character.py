'''Characters
Python does not have a distinct character type. In Python, a character is a string of length
1. You can use the ord() and chr() builtin
functions to convert from character to
integer and back.
Exercises:
1. Create a character "a".
2. Create a character, then obtain its integer representation.'''

x = 'R'
print(ord(x)) #to obtain assci value use ord

'''when we want back to the character then chr()'''
y=100
print(chr(y))
